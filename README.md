Serverless Architecture: Video Playback using Lambda and S3
Overview
A serverless solution to stream video stored in Amazon S3 using AWS Lambda triggered by Amazon API Gateway.
This setup ensures scalability, minimal maintenance, and secure access to video content.
Architecture Components
Amazon S3 - Stores the video file.
AWS Lambda - Fetches video and serves it via API request.
API Gateway - Triggers Lambda via HTTP endpoint.
IAM Roles - Provides necessary permissions for Lambda to access S3.
Workflow
1. User hits API Gateway endpoint.
2. API Gateway invokes Lambda function.
3. Lambda accesses video file in S3.
4. Video is streamed via a pre-signed URL or direct response.
Key Features
No server management required.
Automatic scaling based on traffic.
Secure access using IAM and signed URLs.
Deployment Overview
1. Upload video to S3 bucket.
2. Create Lambda function to fetch video.
3. Grant Lambda access to S3 via IAM.
4. Create API Gateway endpoint and link it to Lambda.
5. Deploy and test using endpoint URL.
Best Practices
Use pre-signed URLs for large files to avoid timeout.
Enable CloudWatch logs for monitoring.
Secure API access with API keys or IAM roles.
Use environment variables for bucket names and keys.
Testing and Access
Use browser, Postman or CURL to hit API endpoint.
Pre-signed URL can be opened in HTML video player.
Check CloudWatch logs for debugging.
Conclusion
This serverless architecture enables efficient and scalable video delivery using AWS services with minimal cost and operational overhead.
